\note{
When accessing services with multiple layers, the layer number must be specified at the end of the service url
(e.g., \url{https://sampleserver1.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Demographics/ESRI_Census_USA/MapServer/3}).

The list of layers and their respective id numbers can be found by viewing the service's url in a web broswer
and viewing the "Layers" heading
(e.g.,\url{https://sampleserver1.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Demographics/ESRI_Census_USA/MapServer/#mapLayerList}).
}
\examples{
url <- "https://sampleserver1.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Demographics/ESRI_Census_USA/MapServer/3"
outFields <- c("POP2007", "POP2000")
where <- "STATE_NAME = 'Michigan'"
df <- esri2sf(url, outFields=outFields, where=where)
plot(df)
}
